# Perceptual Colour Tool

Simple web app (no build step) to:
- Choose a primary colour
- Recommend a 60/30/10 scheme (neutral + two accents)
- Generate OKLCH-based ramps (50–900) for each scheme colour
- Interactively tweak ramps while maintaining perceptual smoothness
- Check APCA contrast for any text/background pair

## Run locally

No install needed. Just open `index.html` in a modern browser.

If you prefer a local server (helps with file URLs):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

## How it works

- Uses `culori` for OKLCH conversions and formatting.
- Ramps are generated by varying lightness with slight chroma taper near extremes for better perceptual uniformity.
- Clicking a ramp swatch nudges its lightness and redistributes adjustments across neighboring steps to keep a smooth gradient.
- APCA contrast is computed live for the preview text and background.

## Files

- `index.html` — UI scaffold, loads culori and APCA via CDN
- `styles.css` — Minimal dark theme styling
- `app.js` — Logic for scheme suggestion, ramp generation, interactivity, and APCA

## Notes

- The recommended scheme treats the 60% colour as a near-neutral derived by pushing hue away from the primary and using low chroma at high lightness.
- You can paste a HEX in the primary field or use the colour input.
- Sliders on each ramp let you adjust base hue/chroma for the whole ramp.
